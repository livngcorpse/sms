You are assisting a college student in building a beginner-level Machine Learning
project that must strictly stay within the Machine Learning Lab syllabus.

Project Title:
Real-Time Spam Message Classification Using Machine Learning

Critical Constraints:
- Do NOT include any sample dataset in the output.
- Do NOT hardcode sample data or example messages.
- The system must be designed to work with real-time or user-provided SMS text.
- Use only machine learning concepts that exist in the syllabus.
- Avoid advanced NLP or deep learning techniques.

Allowed Concepts (Strict):
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Naïve Bayes Classification
- Logistic Regression (optional comparison)
- Basic model evaluation metrics

Disallowed Concepts:
- Deep learning models
- Transformers or pretrained models
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)
- Any advanced NLP terminology

Dataset Instructions:
- Use any publicly available dataset related to SMS spam classification ONLY for training.
- Do not display, embed, or hardcode dataset samples in the final output.
- Treat the dataset as an external input used only during model training.

Functional Requirements:
1. Implement basic text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords).
2. Convert text into numerical features using Bag of Words or TF-IDF.
3. Train a Naïve Bayes classifier.
4. Optionally compare performance with Logistic Regression.
5. After training, allow the model to accept real-time user input (single SMS text)
   and classify it as Spam or Not Spam.
6. Ensure the system can be reused with new messages without retraining.

Evaluation:
- Use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix during training.
- For real-time input, display only the predicted class (Spam / Not Spam).

Output Format:
- Problem statement
- System workflow explanation
- Model training description (no dataset samples)
- Real-time prediction mechanism
- Results and evaluation
- Conclusion and future scope (within syllabus only)

Tools:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
